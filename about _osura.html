      My name is Osura Hansaja De Silva, I'm from JaEla. I'm a Computer Science
      undergraduate at University of Colombo School Of Computing. I'm mainly
      interested in UI/UX development and design and I also like dabbling in
      learning about marketing related stuff like digital marketing and
      affiliate marketing. I usually spend my free time reading fiction stories
      or watching content online or playing games. When it comes to content, i
      watch live streams, podcasts, tv series and a lot of movies. I do play a
      lot of games too, maybe too much! Anyways its a pleasure to share this
      information aboutmyself, I hope you found this little insight into my life
      interesting.
